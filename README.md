# Advent-of-Code
## 2021
2021 is my first Advent of Code!

I'm doing the Advent of Code this year with Swift, using [Swift Playgrounds](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playgrounds/) in Xcode.

For those not familiar with Swift Playgrounds, to get to my code, you need to navigate to the Contents.swift file.

e.g. **Advent-of-Code-2021 --> AdventOfCode2021.playground --> Pages --> Day 01.xcplaygroundpage --> Contents.swift**
